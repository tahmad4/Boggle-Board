# Boggle-Board
This is a board for 5x5 boggle with a scramble button and a 3 minute timer which counts down the last ten seconds. 
This version replicates actual boggle since it uses a die system instead of drawing the letter randomly from a pool of 
potential letters. Each die provides one letter for each board ensuring the board works exactly like real boggle. 

Just a fun little side project to learn Python and to have a portable boggle board since my family plays a lot of boggle.
